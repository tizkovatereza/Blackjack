# Blackjack

Welcome. This repository provides a simplified version of my favorite classic card game, Blackjack. It's written in Python or Javascript, and has been developed with the assistance of three different AI coding tools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Aide.
As a result, you'll find multiple versions of the same program in this repository, including my original version written with help of Google. :)

# Rules of Blackjack
Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to have a hand value closest to 21 without going over. Here's a brief overview of the rules:

## Card Values:

Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) are each worth 10 points.
Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

## The Deal:

Each player, including the dealer, starts with two cards. One of the dealer's cards is facedown.

## Player's Turn:

Players decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
If a player's hand exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the round.

## Dealer's Turn:

The dealer reveals their facedown card.
Dealers must hit until their hand totals 17 or more.

## Winning the Game:

If the dealer busts, any player who didn't bust wins.
If the dealer doesn't bust, then any player with a higher hand value than the dealer wins.
If a player's hand value equals the dealer's, it's a "push" and no money changes hands.
